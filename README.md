Old version of the card game I used to run on my server to play with my friends.
Just a prototype I whipped up in a week or so.

I began rewriting it in TypeScript a long time ago, but eventually lost interest
and gave up.

Also I'm not a frontend dev, so the user interface looks like a pile of shit.
CSS is pure witchcraft for all I know.
